*(Sahand Sorouri – June 2025)*  

---

## 1 · Title  
**Osome Dubai Launch**  
Delivering fair, tech-driven company-setup & bookkeeping for UAE founders  

---

## 2 · Why Dubai & GCC Now?  
| Fact | Source | Relevance |
|------|--------|-----------|
| 13k+ businesses registered **monthly** in UAE (2024) | Dubai DED | High company-formation velocity |
| Avg. agency setup fee ≈ **AED 18k** | Market survey (2025) | Clear cost pain for founders |
| 9 % corporate tax (2023) → compliance demand spike | UAE MoF | Opportunity for bookkeeping + reporting |
| 84 % founders prefer **digital self-serve** options | PwC SME study | Osome’s SaaS edge |

**Gap:** Founders overpay for fragmented, manual services.

* Pain 1 – Opaque fees / upsells
